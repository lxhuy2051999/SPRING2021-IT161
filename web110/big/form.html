        <article>
          <p>
            Nowadays, forms have become a necessary part of our modern life. We
            need them when we want to google things, send emails, post comments
            on social media. Many activities on the internet are related to
            forms. As a result, website designers and developers should create
            forms thoughtfully.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the internet, form is a part of the website that people use to
            send data to the server for a specific action. It can be a search
            box, the text area where we type in URL, or a text box to write
            comments on social media.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a lot of practices that can improve user experience with
            web forms. One way to make it convenient for users is by asking for
            a minimum amount of information related to the action. "Forms are
            hard to fill out on mobile. The best forms are the ones with the
            fewest inputs" (LePage Create Amazing Forms developers.google.com).
            It is an effective way to make users quickly make actions like
            sign-up or purchasing. Indeed, many websites like Github only ask a
            user to provide his name, email, and password to create an account.
            Using appropriate HTML input types and attributes is another
            effective way to create a comfortable feeling for users. They can
            provide information like date, time, and phone numbers with less
            effort. It is especially convenient for users who fill the forms on
            the phone. An example of using appropriate input types and
            attributes is using the autofill attribute. It can reduce the amount
            of typing and problems caused by typos for users. Sometimes people
            type their emails wrong and click the submit button. Then, the
            website requests them to verify their email, and they have to start
            filling the form over again. Autocompleting also makes searching
            things easier by suggesting keywords related to what users type in
            the search box.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another great way to improve the user experience for our forms is by
            splitting a big form into a multi-step form process. This practice
            is really effective for large forms like long sign-up forms or
            surveys. We divide the form into smaller forms that contain a group
            of related fields. By doing this, we can help users feel less bored
            and tired when we want them to fill out a lengthy form. "Try to
            avoid a lot of form elements as much as possible and make it simple
            and less form elements to fill out" (Simon You Suck at Form Design
            ((Probably))- YouTube.com).
          </p>
          <p>
            To sum up, forms are essential for websites and we should make them
            wisely to create convenience for users.
